Welcome to The Art of Storytelling, a four part course focused on the art of telling good stories. 

Participants in this course will analyze the toolkit document, [Telling Stories that Matter: A Toolkit for Exploring your Potential as a Storyteller](https://www.storytellingcenter.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/StoryTelling_Toolkit_Letter_Size.pdf?x65433&x61774 "Telling Stories that Matter") to learn more about storytelling and will discover techniques and excercises to become better storytellers. This document was created from the colloboration of the International Storytelling Center and Partners for Democratic Change.

Videos taken from the [The International Storytelling Center's YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1nheoLVxJ0rhUHQekIWwA) will provide examples of veteran storytellers practicing their craft for examination, discussion, and enjoyment. 

Designed with Learning Circles in mind, this course hopes to also facilitate group collaboration, provide an outlet for expression and constructive feedback, and opportunties for new relationships with people in local communities to foster.
