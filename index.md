Learning Circle: Folktales, storytelling, oral history. 

The brief: To create an engaging Learning Circle around the Summer Programming focus of storytelling. 

Using information primarily from:

Telling Stories that Matter: A Toolkit for Exploring your Potential as a Storyteller
https://www.storytellingcenter.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/StoryTelling_Toolkit_Letter_Size.pdf?x65433&x61774

&

Stories or instructional videos coming from 
https://www.youtube.com/user/StorytellingFestival

Goal:

To piece together a 4 part course that is available late Summer. 

For example, July 14/21/28 and August 4th on Thursday afternoons or nights. 

Each class lasting 1-2 hours. 

Beth had mentioned possible connections she knew in the community that might be interested:

Kirnan Sirah – One of the authors of Telling Stories that Matter, and President of the International Storytelling Center (ISC)

Danielle Pritchett – GPL Librarian - Has an event on July 8th concerning storytelling. 

Kimmie from Central (Central library employee, Stacey Reid is supervisor) – Might still be around and willing to help (is currently looking for jobs).

Just brainstorming how this would work --- targets to hit, goals to meet, etc. 

1. I need to make this a ‘branded’ learning circle, which means I need to add this class to the P2PU site. Typically – classes are just pulled from ‘established’ online course sites, such as Coursera, however, user created courses can be added. 
	To make this happen: 
	1. I need to create the class from scratch details below. 
	2. Add it to P2PU
	3. ‘Open it’ for Learning Circles

2. To Make the class from scratch, per above: 

I need to break down the ‘Toolkit’ document into manageable segments. 
I need to insert videos from the Storytelling Festival to ‘punch up’ the class. 
I need to make homework assignments for classroom collaboration.
I will need to create a syllabus detailing all of the above.

1.	Each weekly class would ideally look like – read ¼ of the document beforehand, say sections 1-3. Take notes on the tips and tricks you found interesting. Be prepared to come to class and talk about how you might use these tools in your own oral histories, writing, poetry, or storytelling. Share and collaborate amongst the class. So, *after greetings, initiate discussion based on the readings. 

2.	In addition to reading coursework documents, and watching videos in class, I could create ‘homework’ assignments for the participants to optionally do and share with the class. These would need to be things that were short in nature (or longer, depending on the # of participants). So, *have homework assignments that lean customers into conversations about the material, and sharing their works for collaborative feedback and enjoyment.

3.	During class *watch videos from the storytelling festival YouTube channel to make the class more enjoyable, but also to learn and listen from master storytellers.  

3. Finally, I would need to promote the Learning Circle.
	1. I would need to open the class on P2PU University
	2. Make calendar entries on GPL calendar
	3. Advertise with fliers, emails to email lists, place on FB. 
	4. Cross-advertise with other GPL programs
	5. Target storytelling/writing/poetry group leaders with targeting advertising email.
	6. Consider a max limit on such a circle (if any)
	7. Set dates, get professional Zoom account access information, invite customers who have 		signed up. 

So, the hardest part of this is going to be actually creating the class, second-hardest will be navigating the bureaucracy of P2PU site to add it, third-hardest gaining permission (if necessary) from intellectual property right holders. 

Rough draft of Syllabus and class design below:

Learning Circle: Folk Tales, Storytelling, and Oral Histories 
Subtitle: A four part series on the art of telling good stories. 

Pre-class #1 information. (This sounds odd, but is actually standard in online classes and Learning Circles I have led). Basically, this will be an email to registered Learning Circle participants on what to expect and to have ready for the first class. 
-	Provide access to the Toolkit document
-	Read pages 1-12, this covers the introduction of why you should study storytelling, and also the interviewing process of storytelling. 
-	(Optional homework, though encouraged). Conduct an interview with someone using the information you learned from the reading. Please bring to class notes, information you gathered, and an explanation of the process you followed including anything you learned. 

Class #1. 
	Introductions
	Brief explanation of Learning Circles, the format, general structure of the class
	Mention any observers and their role from UNCG
Open discussion about how we want the Learning Circle to look
Dive into the coursework – I give brief overview of the reading we were supposed to do, ask for feedback, thoughts, comments.
Play Video from Youtube X
Call for recitals of homework or stories
Exit with expected reading/homework assignments for Class #2 

Class #2.
	Introduction of new members if necessary
Dive into the coursework – I give brief overview of the reading we were supposed to do, ask for feedback, thoughts, comments.
Play Video from Youtube X
Possible Guest Speaker ?
Call for recitals of homework or stories
Exit with expected reading/homework assignments for Class #3 

Class #3.
Dive into the coursework – I give brief overview of the reading we were supposed to do, ask for feedback, thoughts, comments.

Exit with expected reading/homework assignments for Class #4 

Class #4.
-	Dive into the coursework – I give brief overview of the reading we were supposed to do, ask for feedback, thoughts, comments.
-	Play Video from Youtube X
-	Call for recitals of homework or stories
-	Ask for feedback regarding the class
-	Highlight storytelling/writing contests the class could pursue (Find some) 
-	Collect information from attendees who would like to be emailed about future events/circles. 
-	Thank everyone

#### About Course-in-a-Box

P2PU created Course-in-a-Box in 2014 as a free and lightweight tool for building online courses. We wanted to preserve the modular structure of MOOCs outside of the bulky (and often proprietary) environment of learning/content management systems. Course-in-a-Box is open-source, and we welcome contributions [on our Github repo](https://github.com/p2pu/course-in-a-box).

p.s. Designing a course for learning circles? [Check out the Learning Circle Course Creation guide](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/116fJM3GS7XDzilUOL_ynMZ0yTncUD6aVUbcQKsTra6U/edit#heading=h.l36tzg40xcgr) for some best practices on course design.
